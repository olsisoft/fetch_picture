# Fetch Animal Pictures API

## Description

This Spring Boot application allows users to fetch and store images of animals based on the specified type and number of pictures. The application uses an H2 memory database to store image metadata and is accessible via a simple REST API. It can be packaged and deployed in a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17
- Maven
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Build the Spring Boot JAR file

In the root of the project directory, run the following command to build the Spring Boot JAR file:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

### Build the Docker Image
Once the JAR file is built, you can create the Docker image by running the following command in the project directory (where the Dockerfile is located):

```bash
docker build -t fetch_picture .
```

### Run the Docker Container
After building the Docker image, run the container using this command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 fetch_picture
```

## Access the Application
### H2 Database Console
This application uses an in-memory H2 database. You can access the H2 database console through a web browser at the following address:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/h2-console
```

- JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
* Username: sa
+ Password: password

### REST API Usage
You can use tools like Postman or curl to interact with the REST API.

### Save Animal Images
To save images of an animal based on its type and the number of images, use the following API:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/animalpictures/{type}/{numberOfImages}
```

- {type}: The type of animal (e.g., dog, cat, bear)
* {numberOfImages}: The number of images to save

## Examples
### Save 2 images of a dog:

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/api/animalpictures/dog/2

### Save 3 images of a cat:

POST http://localhost:8080/api/animalpictures/cat/3

### Retrieve the Last Saved Image of an Animal
To retrieve the last saved image of an animal, use this API:

GET http://localhost:8080/api/animalpictures/{type}/last

{type}: The type of animal (e.g., dog, cat, bear)

### Example: Retrieve the last saved image of a bear:

GET http://localhost:8080/api/animalpictures/bear/last
```
